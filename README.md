# IT_Projects

Hi, Iâ€™m Kamal Gajavalli. I am currently CompTIA Tech+, A+, Network+ certified and also planning to get certified in CompTIA Security+ in Spring 2026. I am currently learning Microsoft 365 tools. I also have a home lab (Virtual machienes), and I am building a few projects to improve my tech skills. This repo is dedicated to my personal projects.
